## 🧩 What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a visual guide that represents the skeletal structure of a digital product—like a website or mobile app. Think of it as the blueprint before construction: it outlines layout, content placement, and functionality without diving into colors, fonts, or detailed design.

## 🔍 Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes help establish the backbone of a digital experience. Here are the fundamental building blocks that make up a wireframe:

### 🧱 Layout Structure
This defines how the page is organized—what goes where and how elements are visually grouped. It includes the grid system, spacing, and the overall balance of the page.

**Example:**  
A clear layout structure ensures that the hero section, sidebar, and footer don’t compete for attention. It helps users instantly understand where to look and what to do.

---

### 🧭 Navigation
Navigation elements guide users through the experience. These include menus, breadcrumbs, tabs, and links that define how users move between sections.

**Example:**  
Including a sticky top navigation bar in your wireframe ensures users can easily access different sections without scrolling back to the top.

---

### 🗂️ Content Placement
This refers to where text, images, and CTAs (Calls to Action) are located. It emphasizes hierarchy and content flow to support readability and user goals.

**Example:**  
Placing the most important information above the fold (the portion of a page visible without scrolling) increases user engagement and reduces bounce rate.

---

### ⚙️ Functionality Indicators
These represent how the user interacts with the design—things like buttons, search bars, dropdowns, and other interactive components.

**Example:**  
Adding a wireframe placeholder for a login form or shopping cart icon signals critical functionality early, prompting feedback and ensuring alignment with user needs.

---

Each of these elements lays the groundwork for a smooth, intuitive design—turning ideas into user-friendly interfaces long before any color or polish is added.

## 🧬 Types of Wireframes

Wireframes come in different levels of detail, or "fidelity," depending on the stage of the design process and the goals of the team. The two most common types are:

### 📝 Low-Fidelity Wireframes

These are basic, often grayscale sketches that focus on structure and layout rather than visual design. They use simple shapes and placeholder text to represent content.

**When to use:**  
- Early in the design process  
- During brainstorming or ideation  
- For quick feedback and iteration

**Example:**  
A hand-drawn sketch or a Figma frame with boxes labeled “Image” or “CTA” without styling.

### 🎨 High-Fidelity Wireframes

These are more detailed and polished, often resembling the final product. They include accurate spacing, typography, and sometimes even real content or interactivity.

**When to use:**  
- In later design stages  
- For stakeholder presentations  
- Before transitioning to development

**Example:**  
A clickable prototype in Figma with styled buttons, real copy, and responsive layout behavior.
